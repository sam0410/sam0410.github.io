	<u>Before the challenge</u> :<br>I have always wanted to learn guitar, so I gave it a shot in my second year of college. I can play basic songs and I can switch between basic chords. But till now, I am unable to play the barre chords. This challenge is to improve my guitar skills. These days I am trying to balance between a lot of things in my life lately, but as they say :
