	<u>Before the challenge</u> :<br>I have always wanted to learn guitar, so I gave it a shot in my second year of college. I can play basic songs and I can switch between basic chords. But till now, I am unable to play the barre chords. This challenge is to improve my guitar skills. I am trying to balance between a lot of things in my life lately, but as they say :
<div class="wrapper">      
  <blockquote>
    <p>Nobody is too busy, it's a matter of priorities.</p>
  </blockquote>

</p>
The plan : Practice guitar everyday for atleast 20 minutes.
<p><br>
<u>After the challenge</u> : <br>
[15th January, 2020 - One month later]<br>

It is amazing how just 20 minutes a day for 30 days improved my skills so much. Not only did I learn to play the barre chords but also learnt a new rhythm called "Rumba Flamenco". 
Here is a small clip potraiying my progress in this 30 day challenge :<br><br>

Now, I can also play my favourite Hindi song "Hai Junoon" by KK on guitar : I couldn't do this earlier as it involves barre chords. Although, I am still not expert in playing Guitar : But, overall, I am really happy with the progress I made in this challenge.
