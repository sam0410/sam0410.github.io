This personal project is inspired by <a href="https://medium.com/@courtneysymons/what-i-learned-writing-a-haiku-every-day-for-100-days-ad23865ef760">this blogpost by Courtney Symons</a>.
Haiku is a form of poetry which has three-lines. The first sentence has 5 syllables, the second has 7 syllables and the last one has 5 syllables. The number of syllables in a word is the number of times one can hear any of the vowels as separate sound.
Moreover, I am planning to use a new word in each haiku from the <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/word-of-the-day/calendar">Mirriam word-of-the-day calendar</a><br><br>

Day 1 : Embezzle : To steal money you have been trusted with.<br><br>


For embezzling funds <br>
from children's down syndrome trust, <br>
she was imprisoned<br><br>

Day 2 : Torrid : Hot or passionate <br><br>


A long torrid month<br>
the famished farmer prays on<br>
grey skies show mercy<br><br>

Day 3 : Nosegay : A small bunch of flowers <br><br>


wait for someone to<br>
get you silly nosegays or<br>
plant your own garden<br><br>

Day 4 : Auxiliary : Providing supplementary assistance <br><br>

she found solace as <br>
an auxiliary nanny <br>
in an orphanage <br><br>

Day 5 : Provender : Food or victuals <br><br>

my mule is strong enough<br>
to carry coal along with<br>
its own provender<br><br>


Day 6 : Speculate : to form ideas or theories about something <br><br>

Oversharing makes<br>
you look moronic. Let the <br>
others speculate<br><br>

Day 7 : Gnomic : Characterized by aphorism<br><br>

Read her gnomic note<br>
tormented by depression<br>
she had killed herself<br><br>

Day 8 : Cogent : Appealing forcibly to the mind or reason<br><br>

Corrupt parties make<br>
cogent promises they do<br>
not intend to keep<br><br>

Day 9 : Redaction : An act or instance of editing or removing <br><br>

A person cannot<br>
redact his past; but he can<br>
define his future<br><br>

Day 10: Whinge : To complain fretfully <br><br>

Whinging but loathing<br>
to work on things that went wrong <br>
signs of a bird brain<br><br>

Day 11: Desideratum : something desired as essential <br><br>

Delicious food,<br>
good books desiderata<br>
for a happy life<br><br>

Day 12: Hapless : having no luck <br><br>

see strangers as foe;<br>
skeptical of their comrades;<br>
hapless men, post-war.<br><br>

Day 13: Undergird : to strengthen or support<br><br>

luck is not random<br>
I consistently work hard<br>
to undergird luck<br><br>

Day 14: Motley : made up of different people or things<br><br>

motley group of tots<br>
ignorant of the evil<br>
laughing their hearts out <br><br>

Day 15: Addlepated : confused or eccentric<br><br>

crowded festival<br>
addlepated men<br>
causing a stampede<br><br>

Day 16: Evince : to constitute outward evidence of<br><br>

the tortured puppy<br>
evinced hatred of humans<br>
burn marks on its back<br><br>


Day 17: Bildungsroman : a novel about a characters's coming of age<br><br>

On a cosy couch<br>
reading a bildungsroman<br>
with some hot tea<br><br>


Day 18: Calliope : a musical instrument like piano<br><br>

Succulent dishes,<br>
gay calliope music,<br>
Festival is here!<br><br>
