<p>	<u>Before the challenge</u> :<br>
I used to walk to office and workout atleast 3 times a week. I also went for long walks frequently. But now, as it is the quarantine period, I have been sitting on the couch all day, everyday - since a month. I "feel" fatter. My sleep schedule has been erratic and because of this, I feel tired all the time. I have got to change this. In this challenge, I am going to workout for atleast 30 minutes everyday. I am also going to include stretching exercises in my workout sessions to improve my body posture.

    <p>Don't wish for a good body. Work for it.</p>
  </blockquote>

The plan:
<ul>
<li> Repeat the workout plan specified <a href="https://www.blogilates.com/14-day-quarantine-workout-plan">in this blog by Casey Ho</a> for 30 days.</li>
<li> Do the following stretching exercises for 30 days.</li>
</ul>

<u>After the challenge</u> : <br>[May 12, 2020]<br><br>
<p>The major changes that I have noticed is that <b>I feel more positive and happy!</b><br> I guess this is because exercising releases "endorphins" which are natural mood lifters.<p> <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/why-stress-causes-people-to-overeat"> According to a harvard study,</a> overeating isn't the only stress-related behavior that can add pounds. Stressed people also lose sleep and drink more alcohol, all of which can contribute to excess weight. Because of lesser levels of stress, I have been eating healthier as well. </p></p>

</div><br>
 <p>Somedays, I felt demotivated and didn't feel like exercising. But I reminded myself that I needed to turn this negative energy to positive energy by exercising. I have realised that exercising makes me feel good about myself. Everyday, I am inching closer to my goal of being comfortable in my own skin. If it has been a really unproductive day, I feel accomplished after a work out session. During each session, I feel that I give my body the love that it deserves. I plan to continue exercising regularly in the future too.</p>
