This personal project is inspired by <a href="https://medium.com/@courtneysymons/what-i-learned-writing-a-haiku-every-day-for-100-days-ad23865ef760">this blogpost by Courtney Symons</a>.
Haiku is a form of poetry which has three-lines. The first sentence has 5 syllables, the second has 7 syllables and the last one has 5 syllables. The number of syllables in a word is the number of times one can hear any of the vowels as separate sound.
Moreover, I am planning to use a new word in each haiku from the <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/word-of-the-day/calendar">Mirriam word-of-the-day calendar</a><br><br>

Day 1 : Embezzle : To steal money you have been trusted with.<br><br>


For embezzling funds <br>
from children's down syndrome trust, <br>
she was imprisoned<br><br>

Day 2 : Torrid : Hot or passionate <br><br>


A long torrid month<br>
the famished farmer prays on<br>
grey skies show mercy<br><br>

Day 3 : Nosegay : A small bunch of flowers <br><br>


wait for someone to<br>
get you silly nosegays or<br>
plant your own garden<br><br>

Day 4 : Auxiliary : Providing supplementary assistance <br><br>

she found solace as <br>
an auxilliary nanny <br>
in an orphanage <br><br>

Day 5 : Provender : Food or victuals <br><br>

my mule is strong enough<br>
to carry coal along with<br>
its own provender<br><br>


Day 6 : Speculate : to form ideas or theories about something <br><br>

Oversharing makes<br>
you look moronic. Let the <br>
others speculate<br><br>

Day 7 : Gnomic : Characterized by aphorism<br><br>

Read her gnomic note<br>
tormented by depression<br>
she had killed herself<br><br>

Day 8 : Cogent : Appealing forcibly to the mind or reason<br><br>

Corrupt parties make<br>
cogent promises they do<br>
not intend to keep<br><br>

Day 9 : Redaction : An act or instance of editing or removing <br><br>

A person cannot<br>
redact his past; but he can<br>
define his future<br><br>
