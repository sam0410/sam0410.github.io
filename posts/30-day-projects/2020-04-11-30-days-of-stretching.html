<p>	<u>Before the challenge</u> :<br>
I used to walk to office and workout atleast 3 times a week. I also went for long walks frequently. But now, as it is the quarantine period, I have been sitting on the couch all day, everyday - since a month. I "feel" fatter. My sleep schedule has been erratic and because of being lazy, I feel tired all the time. I have got to change this. In this challenge, I am going to workout for atleast 30 minutes everyday. I am also going to include stretching exercises in my workout sessions to improve my body posture. 
<div class="wrapper">

    <p>Don't wish for a good body. Work for it.</p>
  </blockquote>
