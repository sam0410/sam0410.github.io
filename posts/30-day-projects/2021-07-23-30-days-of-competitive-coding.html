          <u>Before the challenge</u> :<br />I work on full stack development at
          least 8 hours a day on weekdays. But, development is a lot different
          from competitive. Ever since I have started working as a full-time
          employee, I don't have the motivation to do competitive coding - as I was not looking for a job switch or interviewing candidates at my current company.
          As I want to start taking interviews for SDE role, I need to brush my concepts again. This challenge is to improve
          my rusty knowledge on competitive programming.

        <u>After the challenge</u> : <br />[October 24, 2021]<br/>
        The update on this blog was long overdue!! I just needed some hands on practice and my concepts were not that rusty after all. I spent some time practicing coding questions and brushing up syntax. I have started taking interviews - and this is something that I really enjoy. I begin my work day by taking interviews as it helps me hit the ground running :D <br />
