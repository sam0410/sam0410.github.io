          <u>Before the challenge</u> :<br />I work on full stack development at
          least 8 hours a day on weekdays. But, development is a lot different
          from competitive. Ever since I have started working as a full-time
          employee, I don't have the motivation to do competitive coding
          anymore. As I want to start interviewing candidates for SDE role, I
          cannot be out of touch of this anymore. This challenge is to improve
          my rusty knowledge on competitive programming.
