This personal project is inspired by <a href="https://medium.com/@courtneysymons/what-i-learned-writing-a-haiku-every-day-for-100-days-ad23865ef760">this blogpost by Courtney Symons</a>.
Haiku is a form of poetry which has three-lines. The first sentence has 5 syllables, the second has 7 syllables and the last one has 5 syllables. The number of syllables in a word is the number of times one can hear any of the vowels as separate sound.
Moreover, I am planning to use a new word in each haiku from the <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/word-of-the-day/calendar">Mirriam word-of-the-day calendar</a><br><br>

Day 1 : Embezzle : To steal money you have been trusted with.<br><br>


For embezzling funds <br>
from children's down syndrome trust <br>
She was imprisoned<br><br>

Day 2 : Torrid : Hot or passionate <br><br>


A long torrid month<br>
the famished farmer prays on<br>
grey skies show mercy<br><br>
