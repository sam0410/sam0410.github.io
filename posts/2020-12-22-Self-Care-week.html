	We are in the middle of a pandemic. And this crisis has presented challenges to each one of us. But, I am grateful for having a stable job and be able to spend quality time with my family. <br>
<div class="wrapper">      
  <blockquote>
  	One day this will be over and we will be grateful for life in ways we never felt possible before.

 As a new-joinee, I was reluctant to take leaves just because it would make me look less committed than my coworkers. I was so wrong! I started feeling indolent, anxious and drained. After being a software developer for more than a year and half, I took a week off from work for the first time. It took me a day to start enjoying my vacation rather than feeling anxious or having a hard time staying off work. I had travel plans but because of COVID, I am utilizing this period for my self care. It is my third day of vacation today and I am already feeling a lot better. I will remind myself to take leaves more often.</p>

<div class="wrapper">      
  <blockquote>
    <p>
    	Sometimes you have to step away to come back stronger.

I have been catching up on my hobbies during this self care week. I painted warli art on a wall - in the balcony of my parent's home. I practiced my guitar. Baked bread, cake and biscuits. I religiously worked out every single day of my self care week. It was a much needed break from work and I have realized that self care is a necessity and should be a priority in every one's life.
