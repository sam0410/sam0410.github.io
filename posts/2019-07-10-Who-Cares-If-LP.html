I was in my seventh grade when I listened to "Numb", my first Linkin Park song. Also, it happened to be the first english song I had ever listened to. It has been 10 years and the song has still been one of my favourites. Chester Bennington became my favourite singer. I have a diary in which I have written the lyrics of all the Linkin Park songs. I used to solve my maths homework by listening to LP. The kind of energy that Chester put into all his songs, got me going. It was my dream to attend a Linkin Park concert. But it broke my heart into a zillion tiny pieces when I got to know that Chester had committed suicide. I remember clearly that I had been listening to "Heavy" on repeat when my friend texted me that Chester was no more. I was shattered. I saw <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM7OopromBM">this heart-breaking interview</a> where he spoke about his depression. He kept us going through hard times by his songs, but we couldn't save him. I listen to his songs even today, and my heart aches. He had been screaming for help through his songs and interviews, but we were too blind to notice. He was just 41 years old when he died. There could be people like Chester around me, who can be saved.

    <p>I have resolved that I would tell people around me how much they mean to me. How much ever awkward or difficult it might be, I have resolved to do this. It might make their day. Or it might save their life. I will do it while I can. While there is time.</p>
